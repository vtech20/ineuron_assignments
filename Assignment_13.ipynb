    "When compared to the CSV file format, Excel is superior; hence, CSV consumes fewer file s. Excel is not only a tool for a financial analyst to undertake a detailed analysis of data and figures, but it is also a gauge of a store of information. An analyst can use excel to create profit and loss statements, perform ratio analysis, summarise large amounts of data, and perform functions and formulae; it is more than just a database. When we compare Excel to CSV, we see that CSV is simply a plain text format of a data set that does not allow the user to perform any deep-dive analysis or apply functions to it. When a user imports data, they should be able to see what they're doing."
